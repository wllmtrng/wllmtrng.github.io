The file ending in `.markdown` generated by `rake new_post["New Post"]` accepts a plain text formatting syntax called Markdown. To learn the Markdown syntax click on the link in the title to go to Github's simple tutorial about Markdown. Keep in mind that the rdiscount Markdown processor that Jekyll (which is the static site generator that Octopress uses) supports Github Flavored Markdown too! There also might need to have a bit of work done to get tables displayed properly by editing the css properties of your theme.

------------------------

Then, to see the html file that Octopress generates, perform the command:
```bash
$ rake generate
```
Proceed to the `.../public/blog` directory, and then to the date of the post, and then to title of the post. The `index.html` file there is the generated file from the Markdown post you wrote.
