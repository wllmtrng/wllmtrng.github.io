After going back and forth in between themes for Octopress
and having each theme define different behavior for things
like the navbar, I recommend moving to the OctoStrap 3.1.
Octostrap 3.1 is basically a theming agent that allows
you to select themes on top of OctoStrap using Twitter
Bootstrap 3.1.

**Note:** If you already have some themes installed, I
recommend installing OctoStrap 3.1 on top of a clean
octopress install in case if there are unremoved artifacts
from your previous theme.
