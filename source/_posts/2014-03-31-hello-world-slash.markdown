In a world of new technology, paridigm shifts, knowledge yet to be obtained, this blog will serve as my private container for such things. In addition, as a byproduct, there will be excellent guides on here for all to use. I hope this will aid anyone that stumbles upon this blog.

I will also post things that are irrelevant to technology, programming, or the Internet. There's definitely more to life than in front of the computer screen and I hope I can show that as well. Enjoy.
