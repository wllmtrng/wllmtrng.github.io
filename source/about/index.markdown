I created this site for the sole purpose of recording and jotting down my interests, excitement, and leisure. Hopefully it will not only aid me but you as the reader.

Besides software engineering, I spend my spare time in the outdoors rock climbing and riding through twisties with my Yamaha FZ-09.
