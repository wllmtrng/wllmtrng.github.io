        <section class="post-content">
            <p>I recently took a free 6 week course about Entrepreneurship at <br>
<a href="https://courses.edx.org">edx</a>, a website that offers online courses from the top
universities about various topics. The course format was <br>
divided into short slides and short videos that diverges from <br>
the traditional webcam in classroom setting. These courses <br>
were made for the online audience, equipped with one page slides <br>
and short videos produced with a complete film crew, ranging <br>
around 2 to 10 minutes each. I highly recommend taking courses <br>
at this site if there is something of interest.</p>

<p>I will now give a brief overview of the class I audited:</p>

<h2 id="mitx15390xentrepreneurship101whoisyourcustomer">MITx: 15.390x Entrepreneurship 101: Who is your customer?</h2>

<p>By lecturing about <strong>Market Segmentation</strong>, <br>
<strong>Beachhead Market</strong>, <strong>End User Profile</strong>, <strong>Total
Addressable Market</strong>, and <strong>Persona</strong>, <a href="http://mitsloan.mit.edu/faculty/detail.php?in_spseqno=9118">Bill Aulet</a> and <br>
Erdin Beshimov attempt to show students how to:</p>

<ul>
<li>Explore and analyze potential applications for their idea.</li>
<li>Choose the most promising markets and estimate their size.</li>
<li>Develop a comprehensive, actionable understanding of the
prospective customer.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="marketsegmentation">Market Segmentation</h2>

<p>Market Segmentation is a systematic categorization of potential markets for your idea.</p>

<ul>
<li>Description of multiple groups of target customers that are
homogeneous and distinct.  </li>
<li>Understand the differences of each group to decide which
market to pursue first.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="howtodomarketsegmentation">How to do Market Segmentation</h3>

<ol>
<li>Identify potential industries.  </li>
<li>Subdivide each industry by markets and market segments.  </li>
<li>Find end users for each market segments. <br>
<ul><li>Describe various tasks and how they would use your product
each end users.  </li></ul></li>
<li>Narrow to 6 - 12 opportunities.  </li>
<li>Go out and perform primary customer research by interviewing <br>
the potential end user.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="organizingprimarymarketresearch">Organizing Primary Market Research</h3>

<p>You want information for each market about:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>End User</strong> - Who specifically will be using your product?  </li>
<li><strong>Application</strong> - Why would the End User use your service? <br>
<ul><li>What tasks will be dramatically improved by using your
service.</li></ul></li>
<li><strong>Benefit</strong> - What problem is solved by the end user using <br>
your product?
<ul><li>Does the end user save money?</li>
<li>Does the end user save time?</li></ul></li>
<li><strong>Lead Customer</strong> - Who are the potential influential <br>
customers?</li>
<li><strong>Market Characteristics</strong> - What are market characteristics <br>
that would promote or impede?</li>
<li><strong>Partners/Players</strong> - Which companies will you need to work <br>
with to provide a solution that integrates with the customers
workflow?</li>
<li><strong>Market Size</strong> - Estimate, how many potential customers <br>
exist if you achieve 100% market penetration?</li>
<li><strong>Competition</strong> - Can the End User go to different <br>
providers?</li>
<li><strong>Complementary Assets Required</strong> - What else does your <br>
customer need in order to get the "full solution", or full
functionality of your product?</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="beachheadmarket">Beachhead Market</h2>

<p>A beachhead market is the first market that you will choose to <br>
pursue. It must give you the advantage and capabilities that <br>
you will use to pursue other markets.</p>

<h3 id="howtopickabeachheadmarket">How to Pick a Beachhead Market</h3>

<ol>
<li>Does your customer have the money to pay for your product?  </li>
<li>Can you easily get the product to your customer?  </li>
<li>Does the target customer have a strong reason to buy your <br>
product?</li>
<li>Can you deliver the whole product as a package or solution?  </li>
<li>Is there entrenched competition that could block you from <br>
getting this business?</li>
<li>Is this a strategic market that will give you capability, <br>
credibility to win other markets taht will be equally profitable?</li>
<li>Is the market consistent with the values, passions, and <br>
goals of the founding team?</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="enduserprofile">End User Profile</h2>

<p>An end-user profile is a description of a narrowly defined <br>
subset of end-users with similar characteristics, needs, and <br>
word-of-mouth.</p>

<h3 id="howtobuildanenduserprofile">How to Build an End User Profile</h3>

<p>Seperate into three broad categories:</p>

<ul>
<li>Demographics - Gender, age range, income range, geographic
location.</li>
<li>Motivation - Motivations, fears, wants.</li>
<li>Behavior - Where do they go to eat, drink, and play?</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="narrowdownfurther">Narrow Down Further</h3>

<p>Narrow down your target customers so you are able to find the <br>
need, wants, and desires of a small group. Once you've <br>
addressed them (beachhead market), then you can expand to other <br>
end users.</p>

<h2 id="totaladdressablemarket">Total Addressable Market</h2>

<p>TAM is the amount of annual revenue expressed in dollars per <br>
year if you achieved 100% market share. Many markets that seem <br>
very attractive at first glance, often end up being much <br>
smaller on closer inspection.</p>

<h3 id="bottomupanalysis">Bottom Up Analysis</h3>

<p>The best way to determin TAM is through a bottom up analysis. <br>
This means to do primary customer research to determine how <br>
many people fit your end user profile.</p>

<p>Complement with a top down analysis, but never replace primary <br>
market research with it.</p>

<h3 id="whatiftamislow">What if TAM is low?</h3>

<p>If the TAM is close to zero, then you need to capture this <br>
market very quickly and convincingly, dominating the market. <br>
This beachhead will give you a powerful position from which to <br>
attack better markets quickly and efficiently.</p>

<h2 id="persona">Persona</h2>

<p>A persona is a description of a single person that your idea is targeted to?</p>

<h3 id="whydoweneedaenduserprofileandpersona">Why Do We Need a End User Profile and Persona?</h3>

<p>The end-user profile tells you who your end users are, but the <br>
persona makes your target end user tangible, unambiguous, and <br>
concrete. The persona should be a real person, someone you <br>
know, so that you can ask them questions and characterize their <br>
behavior.</p>

<p>A persona is also important to ensure that your team doesn't <br>
deviate to far away from the target end user.</p>

<h2 id="lookingbackatthisclassandedx">Looking Back at this Class and EDX</h2>

<p>This class was one of the better ones I have taken online. <br>
Lectures were brief and segmented in such a way where it is <br>
easy to consume the material in chunks. Another nice thing <br>
was that Bill and Erdin brought in MIT graduates to interview <br>
them about their startups.</p>

<p>Hopefully in the future I will have an opportunity to apply <br>
these concepts I have learned at wherever I am employed at.</p>
